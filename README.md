# translator

Deep Learning Neural Networks

OBJECTIVE

The goal of this project is to develop a translator using Atrificial Intelligence (AI). Language translation is a key service that is used by travelers as well as for people who may be settling into a new country. Refer to English to French.ipynb using datasets small_vocab_en.csv and small_vocab_fr.csv. Familiarity with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) will be a helpful basis.

In this project, we will build an AI model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This model translates a small set of vocabulary from the English language to the French language.

FURTHER EXPLORATION

I am curious to see this project modified and expanded to include the top 1000 used words/signs in French, Spanish, Mandarin, Egyptian Arabic and American Sign Language (ASL).
